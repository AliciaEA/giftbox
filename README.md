## ✨ About The Project

**Giftbox** is a simple, browser-based arcade game designed with a "Coquette" aesthetic. It was built as a fun little digital present for **Alisa** during the holidays.

The game features the iconic **"Sad Hamster with a Bow"** meme (recreated entirely in CSS!) navigating through a digital world filled with coding errors.

### 🎮 The Mission
You play as the **Coquette Hamster**. Your goal is simple:
1.  **Run** as far as you can.
2.  **Dodge** the incoming coding bugs (👾).
3.  **Don't crash!** Or the bugs will get you.

## 🌸 Features

* **CSS Art:** The main character (the hamster) is drawn using only CSS shapes and gradients. No images required!
* **Mobile First:** Optimized for touch screens with intuitive "tap-to-move" controls.
* **Pink Aesthetics:** A pastel color palette (`#ffe6ea`, `#d63384`) to keep things cute and festive.
* **Background Music:** Includes a sweet melody to accompany your gameplay.
